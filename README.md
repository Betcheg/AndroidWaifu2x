# AndroidWaifu2x

Android implementation of the famous library **Waifu2x** using the web application from your own server (can't directly use the command line script since android doesn't provide access to the shell without being root).

You'll need to set up your own server in order to make the application work, to do this modify variables in capital letters in the WebApp.java class.
